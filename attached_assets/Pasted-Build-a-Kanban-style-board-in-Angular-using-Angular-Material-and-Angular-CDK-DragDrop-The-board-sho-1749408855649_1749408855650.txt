Build a Kanban-style board in Angular using Angular Material and Angular CDK DragDrop. The board should support the following requirements:

1. **Sections/Columns**:
   - `To Do`
   - `Approved by One`
   - `Approved by Second`
   - `Rejected`

2. **Cards**:
   - Each card should represent a `Request` and contain the following:
     - Request ID and Title
     - Creator/Requester and Review Owner
     - Created Date
     - Status (automatically set by the column it's in)
     - Total Approvals and Current Approval Stage
     - View Comment (button)
     - View Attachment (if present)
     - CTA: “View Diff” → navigates to `/sync-diff/:requestId`
     - (Optional) Tags or metadata indicators

3. **Interactivity**:
   - **Drag and Drop** functionality between columns to simulate workflow stage changes using Angular CDK.
     - Drag can be disabled conditionally (e.g., request already approved or rejected).
     - On drop, call a service to update the backend request status.
   - On **clicking a card**, open a right-side panel or dialog with:
     - Full request information
     - History of comments in scrollable format
     - Downloadable attachments
     - Approval logs

4. **Comment View**:
   - Sticky comment viewer on cards and in the detail view.
   - Ability to view without performing request on card click (non-blocking).

5. **Styling**:
   - Use Angular Material Cards with custom coloring per status
     - To Do: Grey
     - Approved by One: Blue
     - Approved by Second: Green
     - Rejected: Red
   - Cards should resize responsively and stack within their columns.

6. **Architecture**:
   - Use Angular Material modules: `MatCard`, `MatDialog`, `MatTabs`, `MatIcon`, `MatTooltip`, `MatSnackBar`
   - Use Angular CDK: `DragDropModule`
   - Use a shared service to sync drag/drop updates and detail fetch
   - Route `/sync-diff/:id` to open the diff comparison view

7. **Extra Considerations**:
   - Allow optional disabling of drag/drop via `canDrag: boolean`
   - Emit events on column changes
   - Sync with real backend via REST API on drop or approve/reject actions
 add search ,  on all cards , make it jira like
